Reason for using mongodb not mysql:-

In MongoDB, data is stored in JSON-like documents that can have varied structures and this improves query speed.
And also storing data in JSON form is really important because most of the data which are sent to and from servers are sent in JSON form.
In MongoDB, documents are able to have their own unique structure because mongofb is nosql which measn that there is limited constrains.
The connection between two tables is easier because mongo doesn't use joins.
	 For example in order to make many to many relation you can simply use arrays
